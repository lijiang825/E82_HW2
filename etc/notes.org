#+TITLE: Notes

* Topics over Time (TOT)

- topic discovery influenced by temporal info as well as co-occurences of words
- distribution for time: alternatives - Beta distribution

** Useful TOT paper with NIPs results
See [[https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/papers/tot-kdd06.pdf][LDA: Topics over time]]
Their NIPS topics findings (first 17 years):
  - activity in "analog circuit design" has fallen off
  - research in "support vector machines" recently risen dramatically
  - The topic "dynamic systems" used to co-occur with "neural networks", not now
    co-occurs with "graphical models"

** Algorithm
- fit model params according to generative model in which a per-document
  multinomial distribution over topics is sampled from a Dirichlet
- for each word occurrence we sample a topic
- a per-topic multinomial generates the word, and a per-topic Beta distribution
  generates the document's timestamp
- the timestamp is associated with each word in the document
